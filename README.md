# SimpleGUIBuilder

> A GUI for creating/designing Python GUI's.

## Installation

There is none :) just download the file and run it.

## About

I don't really like frontend but I really like the idea of giving my backend/terminal programs something more pleasurable to interact with.

That's when I came across [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI), a simple solution to quickly give my programs an interactive front.
But in checking out PySimpleGUI I found I wanted more and had an idea:
It would be nice if PySimpleGUI and therefore GUI making/designing was in itself more interactive.

And that's how SimpleGUIBuilder came to be:
A GUI for creating/designing GUI's for PySimpleGUI, made with PySimpleGUI.

I hope this will be useful to people :)
