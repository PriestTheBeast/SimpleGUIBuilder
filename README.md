# SimpleGUIBuilder

> A GUI for designing Python GUI's for PySimpleGUI.

## Installation

There is none :) just download the file and run it.

## About

I don't really like frontend but I really like the idea of giving my backend/terminal programs something more pleasurable to interact with.

That's when I came across [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI), a simple solution to quickly give my programs an interactive front.
But in checking it out I found I wanted more and had an idea:
It would be nice if PySimpleGUI and therefore GUI making was in itself more interactive.

And that's how SimpleGUIBuilder came to be:
A GUI for creating/designing GUI's layouts for PySimpleGUI, made with PySimpleGUI.

I hope this will be useful to people :)

## How it works

Quick disclaimer:
With this being a tool for making GUI layouts for PySimpleGUI, you will need to know the basics of how PySimpleGUI works.
But worry not, quick experimentation with the SimpleGUIBuilder will also help you in learning it faster. And as advertised in the name, it should be simple ;)

I recommend you start [here](https://pysimplegui.trinket.io/demo-programs#/demo-programs/the-basic-pysimplegui-program) and then use
[PySimpleGUI Docs](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as needed.

Lets get on with the show. There's mainly 2 steps in creating a GUI with PySimpleGUI:
* Design the GUI, by creating it's correspondent layout
* Create the window and map your code to the GUI.

SimpleGUIBuilder will help you with the 1st step, with designing the GUI's layout for PySimpleGUI.

It's easier to show then to explain here, so I made a quick video where I create [this simple GUI](https://pysimplegui.trinket.io/demo-programs#/demo-programs/the-basic-pysimplegui-program).

## More info

Hopefully the SimpleGUIBuilder's GUI is intuitive and easy to pick up, but I will also explain it here.

There's 3 huge sections:
* **Left - Element Tree**: It shows the layout's structure in a tree form. It's where you can select elements.
* **Middle - Element Action**: Where you can choose to add/remove/move an element.
* **Right - Element Properties**: It shows the layout's structure in a tree form. It's where you can select elements.

On the top you have a bunch of action buttons:
* **About**: about :)
* **Preview**: about :)
* **Import**: about :)
* **Export**: about :)
* **Save**: about :)
* **Apply Properties**: about :)
